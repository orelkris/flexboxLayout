            My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
          </h2>
          <p>
            I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I
            loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it
            because there was too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
            want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
          </p>
          <h3 class="secondary-header">How I turned things around</h3>
          <p>
            I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I
            literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
            and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't
            easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I
            didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
          </p>
          <h3 class="secondary-header">Now I live the simple life</h3>
          <p>
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice
            but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from
            living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
